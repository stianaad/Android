    <string name="popupInformation">Various figures fall from the "roof" and one at a time. As it falls, the player can rotate it (90 degrees each time) and / or move it horizontally. When the figure has reached the floor or hit another figure, it stops and remains in this position, and a new figure comes. The point of the game is for the player to control the figure so that the room fills up as much as possible without empty space. How to control the bricks: touch the left part of the screen: move the tile to the left. Right part of the screen: moves to the right. When you press below the yellow line, you will rotate the tiles counterclockwise</string>
